        <h1 style="color:black;">UX Case Study: Custom T-Shirt Website</h1>
    <h4>Project Background</h4>
    <p>The challenge is to create a custom t-shirt responsive website. I was the sole UX designer on this project. As such, I conducted and created everything from the empathizing with users, conducting interviews,wireframing, prototyping and usability testing. I did not want to create a
    a typical custom t-shirt website. Therefore, after user research and a competitive audit, this product value proposition is colloboration among people while customizing their shirts.
    </p>

     <h4> My Design Process</h4>
     <p>I used the Design Thinking method for this project as it is user-centered and that is the most important aspect of UX design.</p>
     <div class="img-size">

     <img src="./resources/images/Picture1.png" height="auto" width="100%">
     </div>
     <p>As you know, my design decisions have to be informed by user research, that is essiential. Therefore, <strong>I conducted a user interview</strong> of 5 participants which I then turned
     into an empathy map to better understand user needs.I discovered that many target users were odering inaccurate shirts because the websites did not provide a proper sizing chart.
    Additionally, many target users wanted the opportunity to colloborate and customize t-shirts with their friends. </p>
    
    <h4>Personas</h4>
    <p>Based on my user research, I crafted a final user persona that would represent my target group and outline their experience with the platform. </p>
    <div class="img-size">

    <img src="./resources/images/Screenshot (2).png" height="auto" width="100%">
   </div>

    <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
    <p>Based on my persona, I created a user journey map to map Mike's experience using the site and possible pain points and solutions.</p>
    <div class="img-size">

    <img src="./resources/images/takeme1.png" height="auto" width="100%">
     </div>
    <h4>Sitemap</h4>
    <p>Based on my secondary research, I discovered that shopping websites are hard to navigate. Therefore, I decided to craft a sitemap that would provide
        a simple navigation for users. 
    </p>
    <div class="img-size">
    <img src="./resources/images/Untitled.png" height="auto" width="100%">
    </div>
    <p>This sitemap ended up being changed but I am just outlining my initial plans for the website regarding navigation.</p>

    <h4>Defining the Problem</h4>
    <p>The problem statement: Mike is a young professional who needs to understand size charts and customize t-shirts with friends because he needs his orders to be accurate and his friends happy.</p>
    <p>Based on my research, I decided to take on two pain points for this project.</p>
    <p><strong>Pain Point 1:</strong> Users need to colloborate with friends while customizing shirts </p>
    <p><strong>Pain Point 2:</strong> Users need resources to properly understand size charts</p>

    <h4>Ideating The Solution</h4>
    <p>After deciding what exactly the problem is, it is now time for me to provide some solutions. I decided to use the Crazy Eights method and sketch 8 different random versions of the wesbite</p>
    <div class="img-size">

    <img src="./resources/images/crazy.jpg" height="auto" width="100%">
    </div>
    <p>After that I used inspiration from my crazy eights exercise to craft my paper wireframes.</p>

    <div class="img-size" id="stack">
    <img src="./resources/images/paper wireframes (3).jpg" height="auto" width="100%">
    </div>
    <p>Moving from paper wireframes, I crafted a digital wireframe.
    This is the digital wireframe for the homescreen of the mobile app.</p>

    <h4>Prototyping & Testing</h4>
    <p>I now have a low-fidelity prototype so I decided to do a unnmoderated usability study so I can have a better high fidelity prototype when I get there.</p>
    <p>I asked 5 participants to complete two task. Task 1 was for users to pick a shirt and customize it. Task 2 was for users to complete the checkout process.</p>
    <p>After task 1, I discovered that users found the process easy. However, while customizing, they could not track back their design decisions.
        From this newly discovered pain point, I decided to create a redo and a undo button to fix this issue in my next round of designs.
    </p>
    <p>After task 2, I discovered that users found it quite frustrating to rewrite their billing address if it was the same as their shipping. From This
        newly discovered pain point, I decided to solve this, I would design a checkbox and users would click it if their billing address and shipping address is the same.
    </p>
    <h5>Insight 1: Create a undo and redo button so that users could backtrack design decisions.</h5>
    <div class="img-size">
    <img src="./resources/images/Untitled.jpg" height="auto" width="100%">
    </div>

    <h5>Insight 1: Create a checkbox that would allow users to use shipping address as billing address is they were the same.</h5>
    <div class="img-size ">
    <img src="./resources/images/Checkbox.png" height="auto" width="100%">
    </div>

    <p>After iterating and creating new designs from the usability study, I was finished with a high fidelity prototype.</p>
    <p>Check it out.</p>
    <div class="img-size">

    <iframe width="100%" height="800px" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/fbd972e8-a787-4747-b816-a0405a7ca014-ae8a/?fullscreen" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
    <p>I learned that even a small design change can have a huge impact on the product. Like for example, the simple checkbox created alot of progress for users so they would not have to
        retype their billing address if it was the same as their shipping address. Each project shows me exactly how iterative the design process can be. It's not linear and you just follow the steps, step by step
        and you're finished. It is not like that, you are going back and forth between steps and I like it.
